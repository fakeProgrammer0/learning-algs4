## 2.What's in This Repo?

This repo cultivates a small range of **elementary data structures and algorithms implementations in java** while learning algs4. **Notice that the repo contains nothing about the course assignments.**  Here are just java algorithms and their tests.

> Do *not* post solutions or partial solutions to programming assignments (including in the Discussion Forums or public code repositories such as GitHub). -- "Honor code" stated by the course algs4.

## 3.Getting Started

1. Clone the repo and import it as a maven project in your favorite IDE.

2. Download [algs4.jar](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/algs4.jar) and import it into the project classpath.

3. Download test data and place the files under the `resources` folder.

   > This step is required to be fixed.

4. Run the tests and check the code, enjoy yourself : )

## 4.Thanks

Special thanks to [Robert Sedgewick](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rs/) and [Kevin Wayne](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~wayne/contact/) who bring us such a fascinating and enjoyable course as well as computer scientists who designed those great algorithms.
